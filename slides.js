/* ==========================================================================
   Aetherlink x Worldline — Two-day classroom deck
   78 slides, authored from CURRICULUM.md (2026-09-15 revision) plus its
   "Resolved alignment decisions" section, which overrides three points in
   the base document: Assignment 9's AI feedback is required and needs no
   API credentials (folded into Slide 64 + new Slide 65); Slide 27 carries
   the three-tier SDLC / working-method / agent-loop framing; Part 5's
   Jira/GitLab/Confluence MCP connections are the real, primary path.
   One slide = one object in order. See README.md "How to edit a slide"
   before changing anything here.

   Field reference:
     title     - required. Shown as the big heading.
     kicker    - small text above the title (e.g. "DAY 1 · PART 1").
     subtitle  - one sentence under the title.
     type      - one of: context, concept, practice, review, recap, pause.
                 Controls the colour chip and the footer progress dot.
     dark      - true to render this slide on the dark background variant.
     layout    - optional: "steps" | "pillars" | "compare" | "recap" |
                 "exercise" (assignment slides — timer + "Do this now" panel).
                 Leave out for a plain card grid (the default).
     cards     - array of {title, body} shown as the card grid.
     items     - for layout "steps"/"pillars"/"recap": {label, caption, detail}.
     columns   - for layout "compare": {title, items:[...], foot}.
     steps     - the "Do this now" checklist (plain strings) for exercise slides.
     expected  - one sentence: what a good result looks like.
     check     - the checkpoint question a facilitator/participant confirms.
     timer     - minutes, only when the curriculum states an exact duration.
     prompt    - an exact phrase the facilitator can read aloud or paste.
                 For slides with a CURRICULUM.md "Prompt panel" code block,
                 this is that block verbatim (template literals preserve the
                 original line breaks) — do not paraphrase these.
     tagline   - a short bold line rendered under the slide's main content.
     notes     - facilitator speaker notes (never shown to participants).
     visual    - optional illustration, never changes wording:
                 bot: 'wave'|'think'|'point'|'head' (AetherBOT pose)
                 place: 'left'|'beside'|'under'|'timeline'
                 tool: 'map'|'arm'|'toolbox'|'thought' (comes out of his head)
                 target: CSS selector the tool points at
                 art: 'timeline' · cardArt: { <cardIndex>: 'route' } · pillarIcons
                 highlight: [{ in: 'title'|'subtitle'|'card:N', text, tone:
                              'orange'|'purple'|'mark' }] — text must exist verbatim
                 stagger: 'pop' — cards pop in one by one
                 hero: N — card N becomes one big centred statement
                 popOut: N + place: 'popout' — card N's lines pop out of the bot as chips
                 art: 'nested' + place: 'nest' — steps shown as rings inside each other (+ magnifier)

Do NOT let anyone rebuild the game itself — it already works; the real work is Parts A and B, then actually saying Part C's exact phrase at least once.

This is deliberately the same pattern as create-concept-card (Skill #1): the reusable method stays generic, the specific criteria live in their own file.
