   Aetherlink x Worldline — Two-day classroom deck
   109 slides, authored from CURRICULUM.md (2026-09-15 revision) plus its
   "Resolved alignment decisions" section, which overrides three points in
   the base document: Assignment 11's AI feedback is required and needs no
   API credentials (folded into Slide 64 + new Slide 65); Slide 27 carries
   the three-tier SDLC / working-method / agent-loop framing; Part 5's
   Jira/GitLab/Confluence MCP connections are the real, primary path.
   One slide = one object in order. See README.md "How to edit a slide"
   before changing anything here.

   Field reference:
     title     - required. Shown as the big heading.
     kicker    - small text above the title (e.g. "DAY 1 · PART 1").
     subtitle  - one sentence under the title.
     type      - one of: context, concept, practice, review, quiz, recap, pause.
                 Controls the colour chip and the footer progress dot.
                 quiz: its own colour and look (use with visual.quiz).
     dark      - true to render this slide on the dark background variant.
     hidden    - true to skip this slide by default on every laptop (H or Chapters shows it again).
     layout    - optional: "steps" | "pillars" | "compare" | "recap" |
                 "exercise" (assignment slides — timer + "Do this now" panel).
                 Leave out for a plain card grid (the default).
     cards     - array of {title, body} shown as the card grid.
     items     - for layout "steps"/"pillars"/"recap": {label, caption, detail}.
     columns   - for layout "compare": {title, items:[...], foot}.
     steps     - the "Do this now" checklist (plain strings) for exercise slides.
     expected  - one sentence: what a good result looks like.
     check     - the checkpoint question a facilitator/participant confirms.
     (Assignment timers have no preset: the facilitator types the minutes on the slide.)
     prompt    - an exact phrase the facilitator can read aloud or paste.
                 For slides with a CURRICULUM.md "Prompt panel" code block,
                 this is that block verbatim (template literals preserve the
                 original line breaks) — do not paraphrase these.
     tagline   - a short bold line rendered under the slide's main content.
     notes     - facilitator speaker notes, the full text (never shown to participants).
     keyPoints - 3–5 keyword bullets shown above the notes in the presenter view.
     visual    - optional illustration, never changes wording:

  keyPoints: ["Ask literally, let hands go up","Say roughly how many you see","Ask: who uses it every week?","Quick read, not a discussion","Adjust Part 1 pace to room"],
  notes: "Ask it literally and let the hands go up — say roughly how many you see. Follow-up question out loud: 'and how many of you use it every week?' This is a quick read of the room, not a discussion: note whether you mostly have beginners or regular users and adjust your pace in Part 1."

  ],
  keyPoints: ["Name the four agreements","One sentence each","Stress: listen first, then ask","Invite people to hold questions"],
  notes: "Name the four agreements, one sentence each. 'Listen first, then ask' matters most today: many questions are answered a few slides later, so invite people to hold them until the explanation is done."

  notes: "Visually distinguish the two teaching days from the five support days, but don't explain all seven days in detail now — that temptation wastes time here. One sentence per phase is enough; the support days belong to a different facilitator."

  keyPoints: ["Read the subtitle as written","North star for both days","Stress team, not a personal trick","Five words = the recurring test"],
  notes: "Read the subtitle as written — it's the north star for both teaching days. Stress the team part: the goal is not a personal trick but a workflow that solves a real problem for your team and that colleagues can pick up. The five words are the test you'll come back to throughout: is what we built useful, safe, verifiable, reusable, and does it work for the team?"

  keyPoints: ["Two or three minutes only","A handful of voices","Not a design session","Surface real frustration first"],
  notes: "Very short opening discussion — two or three minutes, a handful of voices, do not let it become a design session. The point is to surface real frustration before any tooling talk starts."

  notes: "Click through the five rings live so the nesting is visible: each term sits inside the one before it. Flipchart: draw five circles inside each other, biggest to smallest, and write one everyday example next to each: AI, a chess computer or route planner; machine learning, a spam filter; deep learning, face unlock on a phone; generative AI, an image generator; LLM, ChatGPT or Claude. Deep learning is the layer people usually skip, yet it is why today's generative AI works: the models behind it are deep neural networks. The next slides give each ring its own definition."

Permissions: reading and looking around is low risk, but before it edits a file or runs a command it stops and asks. You answer yes (just this once), yes and don't ask again for this kind of action, or no (and tell it what to do instead). Link back to the terminal slide: you don't need to know every command, but you must understand what you approve. Standing rules (always allow the tests, never touch this folder) live in the settings; /permissions shows them. Modes: the current mode shows at the bottom of Claude Code and Shift+Tab switches between them. Normal asks before each edit or command, which is best while learning. Accept edits lets file edits through without asking, while other actions still ask. Plan mode is read-only: Claude explores and comes back with a plan, and nothing changes until you approve it. Auto mode, if your setup has it, runs without asking each time, but risky actions are still checked and can be blocked. There is also a skip-all-permissions option for automated setups; mention that it exists and that we don't use it. Click to open the gate: this gate is you. Close on the tagline as the rule for both days: every assignment starts in plan mode, and changes only happen after you have read the plan (Assignment 3 uses exactly this contrast between plan mode and auto mode). Optional story: when a hard-to-undo action such as deleting a repository is requested, Claude Code's safety check can block it even after a yes in chat, and the human has to run it themselves; that is permissions working as designed. Before class, open Claude Code on your teaching laptop and press Shift+Tab a few times, so the modes you name match what the room will see (they depend on the version and company settings)."

What it does: after every file edit or new file (PostToolUse, matcher Edit|Write), Claude Code runs npm run validate. The '|| exit 2' part matters: if validate fails, exit code 2 sends the error back to Claude, so Claude sees it and repairs the entry. Without it, only you would see the error. The Example prompt panel shows a working hook to compare with. The test makes it visible: asking for a term without a definition is a deliberate mistake, and the room should see the validate error appear and Claude fix it on its own. If the hook doesn't fire, check /hooks, and restart Claude in the project folder. Close the Day 1 hands-on here: a prompt asks, CLAUDE.md (tomorrow) guides, settings enforce."

After each turn a small, fast model reads the conversation and decides whether the condition holds; when it does, the goal clears itself. /goal with nothing after it shows the status, /goal clear stops it. The lesson is the bad example: “make the page nicer” can never be checked, so Claude either stops too early or keeps going. A good goal names something a test or a person can verify.

Availability: it needs a session signed in with a claude.ai account on Pro, Max, Team or Enterprise, on the Anthropic API. With an API key, Bedrock or another provider, or if the organisation turned artifacts off, Claude writes a local HTML file instead or says it can't publish.

The key insight for this room: in -p mode there is nobody to click approve, so Claude can only use tools that are already allowed. Step 4 works because of their 4b allow rule for npm run validate; the push in step 5 is blocked by their deny rule. Tools can also be allowed per run with --allowedTools \"Bash(npm run validate)\". Pipes work in PowerShell too. Leave --bare for the support days: it skips their settings and needs an API key. Early finishers: add --output-format json to step 1 and look at what comes back (result, session id, cost)."

  notes: "This is where the room applies the Sources of context slide to something of their own, and learns how to handle a CLAUDE.md: they decide what goes in, Claude writes it, they check it and own it. Step 1 is the real exercise: rough notes in their own words (in the prompt or on paper) on what AetherBOT is for, its data (the glossary and concept cards, nothing else), its tone of voice (friendly teacher, short and to the point, playful…) and 3 rules. Good rules to steer towards: answer only from the glossary and cards, say OPEN when unsure, name the source card, refuse off-topic questions, never repeat personal profile details. Step 2: everything that is always true for this project (purpose, data, tone, rules, how to test a change to the bot) goes into CLAUDE.md; the task itself (build it now, where it appears) stays in the prompt for Assignment 7. Step 3 in plan mode, so they see the change before it's written. Step 4 matters most: Claude tends to add rules nobody decided and to make the file long, and a long CLAUDE.md is weaker. Anything they didn't decide gets deleted. Step 5: they edit one line by hand, so they know it's just a text file they own. Show the difference: good, “AetherBOT answers only from data/glossary.json and data/concept-cards.json. If the answer isn't there, it says OPEN.”; too vague, “AetherBOT should be helpful and accurate.” (can't be checked); doesn't belong, “Today: build the chat window and add a quiz command.” (a task, so it goes in the prompt). Tip for later: in a new project, /init writes a first CLAUDE.md from the repo; same rule, read it, delete what isn't true, add what only you know. Nothing is built yet: that's the next assignment.",

  notes: "Three minutes, no more. The room has built two single-method skills (create-concept-card, term-checker). A workflow combines several of them, plus a tool connection (MCP), in a fixed order with a human checkpoint. Each step still keeps its own boundaries and stop conditions, and the agent loop from the working method happens inside each step. In practice the workflow can live in one top-level skill (for example day-start) that lists the steps in order, or in a short instruction file that names the skills. Say plainly: this is the same pattern as the Aether Library, pointed at real work — source, structured output, validation, human approval. The assignment follows immediately."

  notes: "The payoff of the day: skills (Assignments 9 and 11) plus MCP (Assignment 12) become a workflow. Example phrases if people get stuck: “List my open tickets. Read-only.” → “Plan a day-start workflow from 2–3 skills: fetch, sort, brief. Show me the plan first.” → “Build those skills and a day-start that runs them in order. Never change a ticket.” then /clear and “Start my day.” A good split is fetch, sort (new, blocked, due soon, waiting for you) and brief (top 3 priorities, anything unclear marked OPEN). Everything stays read-only on Jira. Real tickets can contain sensitive details; tell people not to share their screen while it runs. If a connection fails, debugging it with Claude Code is part of the lesson: paste the exact error and check /mcp. Partner step: a skill is just files, so the partner copies the skill folders into their own project and runs it on their own tickets.",
